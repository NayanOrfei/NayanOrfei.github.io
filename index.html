            <p class="psize"><strong>The Aye-Aye</strong><em> (Daubentonia madagascariensis)</em> are found in mostly the eastern side of Madagascar. They are often thought to be bringers of evil and often killed on sight. Some say that seeing an Aye-Aye in  village signals a villager will die soon. Villagers claim that the Aye-Aye will sneak into houses and kill villagers, though there is no proof stating any of these claims are true. This creature was thought to be extinct is 1933, but they were rediscovered in 1957. They are considered endangered due to the habitat being destroyed and being killed due to their status of bringing evil to those who see one.</p>

            <p class="psize">The Aye-Aye spends most of it's time high in trees. They do most things in life near the canopy of the tree, including mating, sleeping, eating, and travelling. They tend to create circular nests in forks of branches. They are omnivores, typically eating seeds, fruits, and Larvae. They search for Larvae by tapping on trees to here the echo of where Larvae would be. The tap can be as fast as 8 times per second. Once they find of of these spots they will chew into the wood and use their log skinny fingers to pull small insects from inside. They will spend up to 80% of their nights searching for food. Plus, the males are typically more social with eachother, while the females are more aggressive, often fighting other females over mates.</p>

            <p class="psize">The Aye-Aye has a very strange anatomy, with a body growing up to 3 feet and a long tail.They also have very long and skinny fingers, especially the 3rd finger which is the ongest and skinniest. It is used to tap against trees to find foor(show in the picture to the left). They also have a sixth finger that is used to hold onto trees. As babies they start off as silver and end up becoming very course and multi coloured. Typically having white tips and a yellow or brown undercoat. They have ridges on their ears which let them focus on echoes from when they tap on trees.</p>
